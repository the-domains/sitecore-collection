description: 'Who are the criminals in this story? The FCC has acted to reduce what it calls "excessive rates and egregious fees" of up to $14 per minute charged by federal and state prisons. The commission notes that while contact between inmates and families reduces recidivism, "high inmate calling rates have made that contact unaffordable for many families, who often live in poverty."'
