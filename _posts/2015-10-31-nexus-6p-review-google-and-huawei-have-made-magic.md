description: "A week ago, we took an early look at the Nexus 6P, the larger and more \"premium\" of Google's phones for 2015. Now that I've lived with the 6P for a bit longer, it's time for the full review. As stated in the preview post, the 6P is undoubtedly the more premium of the two new Nexuses."
