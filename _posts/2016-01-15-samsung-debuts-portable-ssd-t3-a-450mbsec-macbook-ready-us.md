description: "Following up on its popular T1 solid state drive (SSD), Samsung today announced the Portable SSD T3 , a tiny, shock-resistant sequel boasting faster speeds and a wide range of capacities. Unlike the T1, which used a USB 3.0 interface, the T3 uses USB 3.1 Type C connectors, which means it's ready for direct connection to the latest 12″ MacBooks."
