  AFTER TUESDAY'S terrorist attacks in Belgium , it took no time for Republican
  presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Donald Trump to compete over
  who could be tougher on Muslims. Aside from the usual rhetoric about locking
  down the borders and halting refugees, Mr. Cruz called for law enforcement to
  " patrol and secure" Muslim neighborhoods in the United States, which is
  similar to Mr. Trump's earlier calls to surveil or even shut mosques.
