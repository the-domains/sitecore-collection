            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sitecore Shifts Focus in 8.1 Release</h1><p>Sitecore just released version 8.1 of its Experience Platform. But this update to its flagship product is not, to coin a phrase, your father's dot release. New features suggest Sitecore is significantly shifting its approach to the market. For example: The Experience Platform is entirely context-focused now.</p><img src="http://www.cmswire.com/~/media/b14513a9e4d146d191d0b0d3ff7c7adb.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
